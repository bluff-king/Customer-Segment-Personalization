    "## 1.1. Project Context\n",
    "This project utilizes the **RetailRocket E-commerce dataset**, capturing real-world implicit feedback (views, cart adds, transactions). The core challenge is to translate raw behavioral logs into a system that drives marketing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source:** RetailRocket E-commerce Dataset (Kaggle).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Business Goal\n",
    "The primary objective is to build an end-to-end **Customer Segmentation & Personalization System**. The system aims to replace \"mass marketing\" with data-driven targeting strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Deliverables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Segmentation Model:** Group customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and behavioral patterns using K-Means/GMM.\n",
    "2.  **CLV Prediction:** Estimate Customer Lifetime Value using probabilistic models (BG/NBD, Gamma-Gamma) to identify high-value users.\n",
    "3.  **Actionable Rules (The Action Board):** A concrete mapping of \"Segment -> Marketing Action\" (e.g., *If VIP -> Grant Early Access*).\n",
    "    * Define clear trigger conditions for each segment (e.g., VIP = High CLV & High Frequency)\n",
    "    * Specify concrete marketing actions and channels (e.g., early-access email, personalized offers)\n",
    "    * Link each action to measurable business KPIs (e.g., conversion rate, revenue per user). (not ensure)\n",
    "    * Ensure rules are testable via A/B testing to measure incremental impact.  (not ensure)\n",
    "4.  **Experimentation Framework:** A design for A/B testing to validate the proposed strategies (Control Group vs. Treatment Group).\n",
    "    * Control Group: Not apply new strategies\n",
    "5.  **Personalization Dashboard:** A visual storytelling tool including:\n",
    "    * *Treemaps* for segment sizing.\n",
    "    * *Stacked Area Charts* for tracking segment migration over time. (?)\n",
    "    * *Line Charts* for product trends."

    "## 1.3. The DOC Framework (Decision - Options - Criteria)\n",
    "To bridge the gap between technical models and business value:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **D - Decision**\n",
    "**\"How to allocate the marketing budget and which promotional channel to use for each specific customer group?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"When to allocate these strategies (seasonal or monthly)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **O - Options (Hypothetical Actions)**\n",
    "* **High Value, At Risk** (High Monetary, but High Recency/Low Probability): Grant **High-value Vouchers** (20-30%) to win them back before they churn.\n",
    "* **Loyal, Low Spend** (High Frequency, but Low Monetary): Trigger **Cross-sell Recommendations** (suggest combos) to increase the average order value.\n",
    "* **Loyal VIP** (High Frequency & High Monetary): Offer **Early Access / Exclusive Service** (Avoid deep discounts to protect profit margins).\n",
    "* **Window Shoppers** (High View count, No Purchase): Use **Flash Sales / Urgency Triggers** to motivate the first transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C - Criteria (Success Metrics)**\n",
    "1.  **Model Performance:** Distinct clusters (Silhouette Score) and accurate CLV prediction (RMSE).\n",
    "2.  **Dashboard Usability:** The final dashboard to clearly visualize the \"story\" from overview to specific actions.\n",
    "3.  **Experiment Readiness:** The framework must define clear metrics (Conversion Rate, Retention Rate) to measure the uplift of the new strategy vs. the old one."

    "## 1.4. KPI Tree & Metric Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the **5-step KPI Tree process**, we structure the metrics based on the available data constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: North Star Metric**\n",
    "**Target:** **GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)**.\n",
    "* *Clarification:* Since the dataset lacks data on cancellations, returns, and basket-level discounts, we optimize for GMV (total value of merchandise sold) as a proxy for Revenue under observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Metric Decomposition (Drivers)**\n",
    "Decomposition Formula:\n",
    "$$GMV = \\text{Traffic} \\times \\text{Conversion Rate (CR)} \\times \\text{Average Ticket Size (ATS)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: We use \"Average Ticket Size\" instead of AOV because order-level (basket) identifiers are unavailable; calculations are item-based.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Driver 1: Traffic (Total Visitors)**\n",
    "* **Metric:** Count of unique `visitorid`.\n",
    "* *Scope:* Out of scope for this project (cannot influence traffic with this datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Driver 2: Conversion Rate (CR)**\n",
    "* **Definition:** % of visitors who perform at least one `transaction`.\n",
    "* **Formula:**\n",
    "    $$CR = \\frac{\\text{Count(Visitors with ≥1 'transaction' event)}}{\\text{Count(Total Visitors)}} \\times 100\\%$$\n",
    "Note: Conversion Rate in the KPI Tree is defined at the visitor level, while funnel-level transition probabilities are used separately for behavioral analysis.\n",
    "#### **Driver 3: Average Ticket Size (ATS) / Monetary**\n",
    "* **Definition:** Average value generated per paying visitor (proxy for AOV).\n",
    "* **Formula:**\n",
    "    $$ATS \\approx \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Price of items in 'transaction'})}{\\text{Count(Paying Visitors)}}$$\n",

    "### **Step 3: Business Levers (Within Project Scope)**\n",
    "* **Segmentation Lever – RFM & Behavioral Clustering (K-Means / GMM):**\n",
    "    * *Purpose:* Group customers with similar purchase recency, frequency, and monetary patterns.\n",
    "    * *Application:* Enable differentiated treatment instead of mass marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prioritization Lever – CLV Estimation:**\n",
    "    * *Purpose:* Identify high-value customers and allocate personalization efforts accordingly.\n",
    "    * *Application:* Focus retention and engagement strategies on users with high predicted lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Personalization Lever – Rule-based Action Board:**\n",
    "    * *Purpose:* Translate segments into concrete marketing actions.\n",
    "    * *Application:* Define rules such as “If Segment = At Risk & CLV High → Retention-oriented messaging”.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Future Extension (Out of Scope):*\n",
    "    * Recommendation systems could be layered on top of this framework to increase Average Ticket Size in future work.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Guardrails (Measurement Assumptions)**\n",
    "1. **Transaction Validity Assumption:**\n",
    "    * All `transaction` events are treated as successful purchases at the recorded `item_price`.\n",
    "    * Returns, cancellations, and refunds are not observable in the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Fixed Time Window Assumption:**\n",
    "    * All KPIs are computed within a fixed historical time window.\n",
    "    * No temporal feedback loop or post-intervention effects are measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Dashboard Visualization & Review Cadence**\n",
    "* **Metric 1:** Total GMV over time (Line Chart) — North Star tracking.\n",
    "* **Metric 2:** Segment Migration (Stacked Area — e.g., how many \"New\" users became \"VIP\").\n",
    "* **Metric 3:** RFM Distribution (Heatmap or Scatter).\n",
    "* *Review Cadence:* Periodic analytical review (weekly/monthly), not real-time monitoring.\n"
