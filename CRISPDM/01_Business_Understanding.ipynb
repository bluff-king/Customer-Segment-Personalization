    "# 1. Business Understanding (CRISP-DM Phase 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Project Context\n",
    "This project utilizes the **RetailRocket E-commerce dataset**, capturing real-world implicit feedback (views, cart adds, transactions). The core challenge is to translate raw behavioral logs into a system that drives marketing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source:** RetailRocket E-commerce Dataset (Kaggle).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Business Goal\n",
    "The primary objective is to build an end-to-end **Customer Segmentation & Personalization System**. The system aims to replace \"mass marketing\" with data-driven targeting strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Deliverables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Segmentation Model:** Group customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), and behavioral patterns (conversion rate, category of items) using K-Means.\n",
    "2.  **CLV Prediction:** Estimate Customer Lifetime Value using probabilistic models (BG/NBD, Gamma-Gamma) to identify high-value users.\n",
    "3.  **Actionable Rules (The Action Board):** A concrete mapping of \"Segment -> Marketing Action\" (e.g., *If VIP -> Grant Early Access*, If Prospect -> ..., If Hibernating ->...).\n",
    "    * Define clear trigger conditions for each segment (e.g., VIP = High CLV & High Frequency)\n",
    "    * Specify concrete marketing actions and channels (e.g., early-access email, personalized offers)\n",
    "    * Propose measurable business KPIs for future evaluation (e.g., conversion rate, revenue per user).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Experimentation Framework:** Since the dataset is static and observational, direct A/B testing cannot be conducted. Instead, this project proposes an experimentation framework that could be applied in a real production environment.\n",
    "The framework includes (không chắc) :\n",
    "- Definition of control and treatment groups per segment.\n",
    "- Suggested success metrics (e.g., uplift in conversion rate, incremental revenue).\n",
    "- Guidelines for experiment duration and sample size considerations.\n",
    "    * Note: Control Group: Not apply new strategies\n",
    "5.  **Personalization Dashboard:** A visual storytelling tool including:\n",
    "    * *Treemaps* for segment sizing.\n",
    "    * *Line Charts* for product trends.\n",
    "    * (thêm)"

    "**\"How to allocate the marketing budget and which promotional channel to use for each specific customer group?\"**\n",
    "\n",

    "### **O - Options (Hypothetical Actions)**\n",
    "* **VIP Zone – Loyal Customers**  \n",
    "  (High Frequency & High Monetary):  \n",
    "  Offer **Early Access / Exclusive Benefits** to maintain engagement while protecting profit margins.\n",
    "* **Growth Zone – Recent & High Potential**  \n",
    "  (Recent activity, moderate spend, high conversion tendency):  \n",
    "  Trigger **Welcome or Second-Purchase Incentives** to encourage repeat purchases.\n",
    "* **Low Value Zone – Low Spend & Low Loyalty**  \n",
    "  (Low Frequency & Low Monetary, but still active):  \n",
    "  Apply **Light Promotions or Bundle Offers** to increase purchase intent and basket size.\n",
    "* **Hibernating Zone – At Risk Customers**  \n",
    "  (Long time since last purchase, declining engagement):  \n",
    "  Use **Win-back Campaigns with Time-Limited Vouchers** to reactivate customers.\n",
    "* **Non-Transactors**  \n",
    "  (Users with views/add-to-cart but no transactions):  \n",
    "  Target with **acquisition-style tactics**: onboarding emails, first-purchase discounts, product discovery flows, and remarketing to convert to first purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C – Criteria (Success Metrics)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Segmentation Quality (Interpretability & Stability):**  \n",
    "   Customer segments should be clearly interpretable based on RFM and CLV characteristics, showing consistent and meaningful behavioral differences that can support business decision-making (rather than purely optimizing statistical metrics).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Business Actionability (không chắc có cái này không):**  \n",
    "   Each segment must be easily mapped to a distinct marketing strategy (e.g., retention, growth, reactivation), ensuring that the segmentation results are actionable in real-world marketing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dashboard Effectiveness:**  \n",
    "   The dashboard should clearly communicate the segmentation insights, segment sizes, and proposed actions, enabling stakeholders to quickly understand customer distribution and prioritize interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experiment Readiness (Conceptual):**  \n",
    "   The framework should define clear evaluation metrics (e.g., Conversion Rate, Retention Rate, Revenue per User) that could be used in future A/B testing to measure the effectiveness of personalized strategies.\n"

    "## 1.4. KPI Tree & Metric Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the **5-step KPI Tree process**, we structure the metrics based on the available data constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: North Star Metric**\n",
    "**Target:** **GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)**.\n",
    "* *Clarification:* Since the dataset lacks data on cancellations, returns, and basket-level discounts, we optimize for GMV (total value of merchandise sold) as a proxy for Revenue under observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Metric Decomposition (Drivers)**\n",
    "Decomposition Formula:\n",
    "$$GMV = \\text{Traffic} \\times \\text{Conversion Rate (CR)} \\times \\text{Average Ticket Size (ATS)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: We use \"Average Ticket Size\" instead of AOV because order-level (basket) identifiers are unavailable; calculations are item-based.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Driver 1: Traffic (Total Visitors)**\n",
    "* **Metric:** Count of unique `visitorid`.\n",
    "* *Scope:* Out of scope for this project (cannot influence traffic with this datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Driver 2: Conversion Rate (CR)**\n",
    "* **Definition:** % of visitors who perform at least one `transaction`.\n",
    "* **Formula:**\n",
    "    $$CR = \\frac{\\text{Count(Visitors with ≥1 'transaction' event)}}{\\text{Count(Total Visitors)}} \\times 100\\%$$\n",
    "Note: Conversion Rate in the KPI Tree is defined at the visitor level, while funnel-level transition probabilities are used separately for behavioral analysis.\n",
    "#### **Driver 3: Average Ticket Size (ATS) / Monetary**\n",
    "* **Definition:** Average value generated per paying visitor (proxy for AOV).\n",
    "* **Formula:**\n",
    "    $$ATS \\approx \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Price of items in 'transaction'})}{\\text{Count(Paying Visitors)}}$$\n",

    "### **Step 3: Business Levers (Within Project Scope)**\n",
    "* **Segmentation Lever – RFM & Behavioral Clustering (K-Means / GMM):**\n",
    "    * *Purpose:* Group customers with similar purchase recency, frequency, and monetary patterns.\n",
    "    * *Application:* Enable differentiated treatment instead of mass marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prioritization Lever – CLV Estimation:**\n",
    "    * *Purpose:* Identify high-value customers and allocate personalization efforts accordingly.\n",
    "    * *Application:* Focus retention and engagement strategies on users with high predicted lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Personalization Lever – Rule-based Action Board:**\n",
    "    * *Purpose:* Translate segments into concrete marketing actions.\n",
    "    * *Application:* Define rules such as “If Segment = At Risk & CLV High → Retention-oriented messaging”.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Future Extension (Out of Scope):*\n",
    "    * Recommendation systems could be layered on top of this framework to increase Average Ticket Size in future work.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Guardrails (Measurement Assumptions)**\n",
    "1. **Transaction Validity Assumption:**\n",
    "    * All `transaction` events are treated as successful purchases at the recorded `item_price`.\n",
    "    * Returns, cancellations, and refunds are not observable in the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Fixed Time Window Assumption:**\n",
    "    * All KPIs are computed within a fixed historical time window.\n",
    "    * No temporal feedback loop or post-intervention effects are measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Dashboard Visualization & Review Cadence**\n",
    "* **Metric 1:** Total GMV over time (Line Chart) — North Star tracking.\n",
    "* **Metric 2:** Segment Migration (Stacked Area — e.g., how many \"New\" users became \"VIP\").\n",
    "* **Metric 3:** RFM Distribution (Heatmap or Scatter).\n",
    "* *Review Cadence:* Periodic analytical review (weekly/monthly), not real-time monitoring.\n"
